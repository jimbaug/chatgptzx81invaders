This program displays a player-controlled "*"(asterisk) at the bottom of the screen, and randomly generates an "O" in the top row of the screen, representing an enemy. The player must move their asterisk left and right to avoid the enemy's "O" while firing back to destroy it. The game ends when the enemy reaches the bottom of the screen or the player reaches a certain score.

Note that this is a very simple version of Space Invaders, and there are many ways to expand and improve upon it.
